Instructions to Run the Code:

1. MATLAB must be installed.
2. The files should all be in the same directory.
3. Open the directory in MATLAB.
4. Run each program from the MATLAB command window:
  phantom_one
  phantom_two
  phantom_three
  run_modified_phantom (this was to test the initial implementation)
5. Download any dependencies (I had previously installed image processing toolbox, but it may not be necessary)
